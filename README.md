# IA_Project1

In this project the main task is adding several agents with a different behaviour for each one using NavMesh. First of all let's add a First Person player controller as an objective to the agents. There are 3 types of agents depending on its color (Blue,Green,Red):

Red agent's covers everything

Blue agent's covers everything but Jump.

Green agent's covers everything but Corridor.

Also each agent has a different speed (2.5, 3, 3.5). This way each agent needs to find different paths to reach de player.

Sample 1) Blue agent following player through the corridor.
